# 🌈 📱 🖥   Welcome to the Digitalization Frontend code test 
This test is designed to let us get to know you more as a developer and give you a hint about some of the toolsets we use in our daily work. 

### ⚙️  The task
1. We want to get a clear overview of the different rockets that SpaceX has available.
2. We want to be able to sort them by weight. 
3. It’s also important for us to know about the past 5 launches, feel free to display any relevant information about the launch.

We want to use: https://api.spacex.land/graphql/

### 🔋⚡️ Bonus
We had a discussion about whether or not we could supply the SpaceX launchpads with our own batteries. In order to do that we would like to know: how far away they are from our factory Ett in Skellefteå. A UI that displays their location and a description would help our planning team a lot. 

**Now that we are done with the main task, it would also be nice to:**

- Setup a good test-suite for your application
- Union and schema-type generation
- Create a clean visual design
- Have an idea of how we can deploy this new application

### 🤖  Technical requirements
Please use these tools and frameworks as we like to use them in our work:

- React 
- Typescript
- GQL

### 🎉  Delivery and Presentation
Zip your source and send in your code-test to your Northvolt contact.

We want to then invite you to a code session where you are expected to present and walkthrough your code. 

### 📖  Tools Documentation
Here are some general guidelines and recommended toolset you can use to solve the task at hand:


**Apollo**

A good GQL client using the latest techniques.
