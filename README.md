# 🌈 📱 🖥   Welcome to the Digitalization Frontend code test 
This test is designed to let us get to know you more as a developer and give you a hint about some of the toolsets we use in our daily work. 

### ⚙️  The task
- We want to get a clear overview of the different rockets that SpaceX has available.
- We want to be able to sort them by weight. 
- It’s also important for us to know if there are any upcoming launches planned, so we don't miss the next one. 

We want to use: https://api.spacex.land/graphql/

### 🔋⚡️ Bonus
We had a discussion about whether or not we could supply the SpaceX launchpads with our own batteries. In order to do that we would like to know: how far away they are from our factory Ett in Skellefteå.  A UI that displays their location and a description would help our planning team a lot. 

**Now that we are in production it would also be nice to:**

- Setup a good test-suite for your application
- Union and schema-type generation
- Create a clean visual design
- Have an idea of how we deploy this new app

### 🤖  Technical requirements
Please use these tools and frameworks as we like to use them in our work:

- React 
- Typescript
- GQL

### 🎉  Delivery and Presentation
Zip your source and send in your code-test to your Northvolt contact.

We want to then invite you to a code session where you are expected to present and walkthrough your code. 

### 📖  Tools Documentation
Here are some general guidelines and recommended toolset you can use to solve the task at hand:


**Apollo**

A good GQL client using the latest techniques.
